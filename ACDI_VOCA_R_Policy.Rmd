## RStudio

RStudio is an IDE for the R programming language and is the IDE of choice for ACDI/VOCA for using R. Split into two editions, RStudio for Desktop and RStudio Server, it is an incredibly empowering tool that allows one to use R to its full potential. The different panels in RStudio such as "Environment", "Files", "Help", "History" allows for easy organization and interacting with all the files and objects in your analysis.

Above is what a RStudio set up might look like. You can spend time to position and size each of the panels however you want along with a great many other aesthetical aspects like the code font and color. 

## R Projects

Using R Projects is a vital part of keeping your work separately contained with its own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents. Instead of cluttering up your environment with multiple objects from multiple projects you can have a number of different projects opened in its own window so things from one project won't interfere with another.

A great resource to get started with R Projects is [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects). 

For a general overview of a project-oriented workflow in R, consult this website (still work-in-progress) [here](https://whattheyforgot.org/project-oriented-workflow.html) written by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester from R Studio. For a shorter blogpost version of the above see [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/
).

## GitHub

Now that you have everything organized by using Projects you might want to backup and version control your code and analyses using GitHub. Using GitHub will also allow you to coordinate and collaborate with other analysts on the same project, you will never again have to search your email for "datafile_revised.data" or "final_final_final_draft3.doc"! 

A great introduction to switching over to a version control system for your projects can be read [here](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/).

For connecting your RStudio Project to Git and GitHub check out this [chapter](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) of the book, "Happy Git with R" by Jenny Bryan.

## The Tidyverse and Coding Style

![](https://rviews.rstudio.com/post/2017-06-09-What-is-the-tidyverse_files/tidyverse1.png)

The Tidyverse is a set of R packages specifically designed for doing data science. The packages are consistent in their underlying design and structure which makes it very easy to learn. In regards to syntax and coding style, ACDI VOCA follows the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for consistent development of our code and tools. One of the main strengths of the tidyverse is that the code is very easily readable by a human compared to base R code. Some great examples of this can be seen [here](https://tavareshugo.github.io/data_carpentry_extras/base-r_tidyverse_equivalents/base-r_tidyverse_equivalents.html) in a great webpage that shows how to do something in both base R and the tidyverse!

The best way to get oriented with the tidyverse packages is to go through Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book which is provided online and for free! You can also go visit the Slack group for R4DS [here](https://rfordatascience.slack.com/) to get online help.

Some particular notes on how we write R code:

- For commenting lines out we use ONE `#` whereas if we want to make a comment in the code we use TWO `##`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data %>% 
  select(this, that, everything()) %>% 
  ## Calculate values here:
  mutate(nutrition10 = nutrition * 10,
         ham_production = ham + production - costs) %>% 
  ## We need to filter by values over 5000:
  filter(nutrition10 > 5000) %>% 
  ## No need to arrange by DESC order anymore:
  #arrange(desc(nutrition10))
```

- Avoid using `for` loops or the `apply()` family of functions (`sapply`, `lapply`, `vapply`, etc.) and use the `map()` functions from the `purrr` package instead. Note that there is nothing wrong with using `for` loops in R necessarily but we want to keep everything consistent across the codebase.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
## calculate the mean for 10 observations of a randomly generated normal distribution
1:10 %>%
  map(rnorm, n = 10) %>%
  map_dbl(mean)
```

- For naming functions and arguments we use snakecase. Ex. `ConnectToMEF()` and `fieldToMod = "Indicators"`.

```{r}
AddThenSubtract <- function(entryNumber, subtractionNumber) {
  
  sum <- entryNumber + 25 - subtractionNumber
  
  sum
}

AddThenSubtract(entryNumber = 5, subtractionNumber = 3.5)
```

## Installing an R Package


There is a tab in R Studio that helps you manage installing packages. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/byRVkX7.jpg)

From here you can choose from where you want to install a package, either from CRAN or a local `.tar.gz` or `.zip` file. Then you just type the name of the package in, be very careful with the proper capitalization and underscore/dash in the names! Then, make sure you are installing the package into the proper directory, check whether you want to install dependencies or not and click install. Remember that after installing you need to load the package with a `library()` call every new session.

If you want to install from the console or in a script:

```{r}
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)

## let's look at one of the datasets from our newly installed package!
glimpse(airlines)
```

Not all packages are available on CRAN, here's how you would install a package from GitHub:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ACDIVOCATech/bulletchartr")

library(bulletchartr)
```

## Where to find inspiration and HELP!

R is an open-source language with tons of community support online and in print. A great way to read up on the latest R news is to go on Twitter and search for `#rstats`. You should also subscribe to [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) to get a curated stream of news, blog posts, and tutorials provided by thousands of R users from across the world. 

For getting help, go over to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and look up questions tagged with `[r]` and any other R package you might be having trouble with. Another good resource that is solely dedicated to R problems and discussion is [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/). One can also try asking for help on Twitter via the `#rstats` hashtag as well! There is also the `R for Data Science` Slack ([here](https://www.rfordatasci.com/)) for a more interactive community to get help and learn more about R. 

## Create/develop R packages

At ACDI/VOCA we have a whole suite of packages that helps us gather and process data from our databases and output them into a variety of dashboards and visualizations. The [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham is a great and free online resource for those who want to create their own package to help with their analysis or contribute to one of our own existing packages.

When collaborating on packages (this can apply to projects too) it is important to create your own branch alongside the main stream of development. This allows you and others to work in parallel without overwriting eachother's work. A good way to organize things is that you leave the main "master" branch alone while everybody 

When using an ACDI/VOCA R package, please remember to PULL the latest version from Github from the Github panel in RStudio. When contributing to any of our R packages please create your own branch and when you're done submit a Pull Request to the package authors. For an introduction on contributing to open-source using GitHub, see [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

## Misc

Here are some general best practices that should be followed:

 - Inputs into complex functions should be stated explicitly, example: DO THIS: `function(arg1 = x, arg2 = y)` instead of this: `function(x,y)`. It's a bit more annoying, but does help resolve conflicts, especially when working with packages like `ACDIVOCAdataGetter` that are continuously in active development.
 - Use `tibble` and `as_tibble` rather than `data.frame` and `as.data.frame`
 
## For Admins: how to test pull requests:

 1.	Git fetch
 2.	Switch branch to one to test
 3.	Build Package using “BUILD > MORE > CLEAN AND REBUILD”. Alternatively, use R CMD INSTALL –preclean in console.
 4.	Run tests (Ctrl + Shift + T). If this passes, continue
 5.	See if Issue has been resolved. If yes, Merge with Master, and delete branch.
 6.	Pull Master into the server, turn off PT/GQ runners on crontab, run Day_Deleter() and stay vigilant for 30 mins. All should be good.
 7.	Delete local branch (run `git gc` or `git prune` or `git branch -D branch_name`).
